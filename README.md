# Notice

This repo is no longer updated because I find a better frame: [pygls](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls)

## Thanks
I have referred the following projects:
- [palantir/python-language-server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server)

And stream.py is a copy of pyls_jsonrpc.streams
